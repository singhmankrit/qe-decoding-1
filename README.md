# Quantum Error Correction Decoders

This repository implements decoders for Quantum Error Correction, focusing on the **repetition code** with both ideal and noisy ancilla measurements.

## Key Features

- Written in **Stim** (fast stabilizer circuit simulator) and **PyMatching** (MWPM decoder).
- Generates decoding graphs for **Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM)** decoding.
- Calculates **logical error rates** for various code distances.
- Determines the **error threshold** by analysing performance under different noise models.
